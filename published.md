One part of the analyses was performed to detect the six confirmed contaminant sequences in published datasets. 
The first steps were performed analogous to the [main analysis](main_steps.md), as documented in [runAnalysis_smallRNA_noSalmonella.sh](runAnalysis_smallRNA_noSalmonella.sh).
The cross-sample analysis steps are documented in [cluster_steps_publishedData.sh](cluster_steps_publishedData.sh): Recurrent sequences were extracted using [findAbove1PerSampleUnmapFasta.py](findAbove1PerSampleUnmapFasta.py) and subsequently clustered to the contaminant sequences using [CD-HIT's](http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/) cd-hit-est.  [evaluate_seqOICounts.R](evaluate_seqOICounts.R) was used to convert the results into a table. The number of reads in all samples were documented. 
Using metadata (provided in [allLibsMeta.txt](allLibsMeta.txt)), the total number of reads in each sample ([allReads.tsv](allReads.tsv)) and the result of the clustering to the contaminant sequences ([public.readCountsPerSeqOIPerSample.unmapped.14.t.tsv](public.readCountsPerSeqOIPerSample.unmapped.14.t.tsv)), an overview figure for all analysed datasets was plotted. This was done in R, as documented in [figure3_publishedData.R](figure3_publishedData.R), using the package [gplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html). A further utility function ([heatmap.2m.R](heatmap.2m.R)) and the packages [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html) and [scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/) were used to provide the parts of a supplementary figure which details the relative levels of the six sequences in those datasets which were found to contain any of the contaminant reads.
