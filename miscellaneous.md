## Figure 2:
Figure 2 is based purely on qPCR results which were processed in Microsoft excel. [figure2_WS.Rdata](figure2_WS.Rdata) contains the necessary objects for plotting. [figure2_qPCR-results.R](figure2_qPCR-results.R) produces the figure. It relies on the [gplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) package.

## Figure 4A:
Figure 4A is also based purely on qPCR results which were processed in Microsoft excel. [161013_qiaSummary_withDnase_extractUCTvsOld.txt](161013_qiaSummary_withDnase_extractUCTvsOld.txt) contains the data, exportied from Microsoft Excel. [figure4A_qPCR-results.R](figure4A_qPCR-results.R) first slightly reformats these data, which is then used to make the plot. It relies on the [gplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) and [scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/) packages.
To check if the same results were observed in the sequencing data, Supplementary Figure 3 was created using [supplementaryFigure3_reducedContaminants.R](supplementaryFigure3_reducedContaminants.R), which uses the [gplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) and [scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/) packages. The data is taken from [matchcountSeqOIPerSample4plot.txt](matchcountSeqOIPerSample4plot.txt), which was prepared in Microsoft excel using the results of 170816_seqOI_bymapping.RXXX.
